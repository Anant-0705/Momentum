# Momentum - Play the Crowd

A decentralized social staking protocol built on Base Sepolia. Predict outcomes, stake your conviction, and win together.

## 🚀 Features

- **Social Consensus**: Predict crowd behavior, not just facts
- **Hidden Stakes**: Fair competition with stakes revealed only after contests end
- **Instant Settlement**: Winners automatically share the losing side's pot
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with RainbowKit and wagmi
- **Modern UI**: Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Wallet**: wagmi, RainbowKit, viem
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide icons
- **Network**: Base Sepolia (testnet)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Stake**: Choose your side and stake USDC on the outcome
2. **Wait**: Stakes are hidden until the contest ends to keep things fair
3. **Win**: The side with more stake wins, and winners share the losing side's pot
